I am a developer, specializing in C++, Python, and rust, although I can do other stuff with programming and server maintenance and management.
Currently I am an engineer at [Blockstream](https://blockstream.com/).
I primarily work on, and am a maintainer of, the [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) and on the [Hardware Wallet Interface](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/hwi) projects.
My focus is on wallet functionality and interoperability between different wallet software.
I also perform [Guix builds (previously Gitian)](_posts/2016-01-23-Gitian-builder.md) for Bitcoin Core and all build results can be found on my [Github fork of Bitcoin](https://github.com/achow101/bitcoin/releases).

Every Monday at 2 PM Eastern Time (America/New York Timezone), I livestream my work on Bitcoin Core and HWI on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/achow101/).

I am also the moderator of the [Technical Support](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=4.0) and [Development and Technical Discussion](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=6.0) sections of [Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org), as well as the [Bitcoin StackExchange](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/).

## Projects

I have worked on many projects, all of which are open source and can be viewed in my [Github account](https://github.com/achow101).
Some of these projects are for myself and others projects commissioned by others.
Some of my projects involve modifying existing open source projects
Occasionally I also contribute to other open source projects that I use either personally or as a dependency of my other work.
