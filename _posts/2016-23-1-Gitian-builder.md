I am now officially a Gitian builder for the Bitcoin Core project. My PGP key has been [added to the repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/gitian-downloader/achow101-key.pgp). I will be building all of the releases, including the Release Candidate builds and the official releases. My builds will be committed to the [Bitcoin Gitian sigs repo](https://github.com/bitcoin/gitian.sigs) as well as [my own Gitian sigs repo](https://github.com/achow101/gitian.sigs).

Not only am I doing Gitian builds, I am also posting my Gitian builds on [my Bitcoin repo}(https://github.com/achow101/bitcoin/releases). Those builds include all of the RCs and releases that I have built. I have also done some historic builds and those are hosted there. The Gitian sigs of all of those builds are hosted in my Gitian sigs repo and you should always verify them before running any Bitcoin Core build that you download.
