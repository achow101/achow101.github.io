## Welcome to the website of Andrew Chow

I am a developer, specializing in C++, Python, and Java although I can do other stuff with programming and server maintenance and management. I am a [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) and [Bitcoin Armory](https://btcarmory.com) developer. I also perform [Gitian builds](_posts/2016-01-23-Gitian-builder.md) for Bitcoin Core.

I am also the moderator of the [Technical Support](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=4.0) and [Development and Technical Discussion](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=6.0) sections of [Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org)

If you would like to support my work, tip me some Bitcoin at [33ZXwuw7KwC69yAtahfX1jNtFuQwLVwJXp](bitcoin:33ZXwuw7KwC69yAtahfX1jNtFuQwLVwJXp)


### My Work

I have worked on many projects, all of which are open source and can be viewed in my [Github account](https://github.com/achow101). Some of these projects are for myself and others projects commissioned by others. Some of my projects involve modifying existing open source projects
