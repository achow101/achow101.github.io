I am a developer, specializing in C++, Python, and Java although I can do other stuff with programming and server maintenance and management.
Currently I am an engineer at [Blockstream](https://blockstream.com/).
I primarily work on [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) and on the [Hardware Wallet Interface](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/hwi).
My focus is on wallet functionality and interoperability between different wallet software.
I also perform [Gitian builds](_posts/2016-01-23-Gitian-builder.md) for Bitcoin Core and all build results can be found on my [Github fork of Bitcoin](https://github.com/achow101/bitcoin/releases).

I am also the moderator of the [Technical Support](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=4.0) and [Development and Technical Discussion](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=6.0) sections of [Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org)

## Projects

I have worked on many projects, all of which are open source and can be viewed in my [Github account](https://github.com/achow101).
Some of these projects are for myself and others projects commissioned by others.
Some of my projects involve modifying existing open source projects
