## Welcome to the website of Andrew Chow

I am a developer, specializing in C++, Python, and Java although I can do other stuff with programming and server maintainence and management. I am a [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) and [Bitcoin Armory](https://btcarmory.com) developer.

I am available for hire to do a variety of programing jobs and Bitcoin related work.

I am also the moderator of the [Technical Support](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=4.0) and [Development and Technical Discussion](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=6.0) sections of [Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org)

I like donations, and if you want to tip me, please tip me some Bitcoin to [1Doqm1wHhJ6YzyfrKjNvBDuhLkazifBRFU](bitcoin:1Doqm1wHhJ6YzyfrKjNvBDuhLkazifBRFU)


### My Work

I have worked on many projects, all of which are open source and can be viewed in my [Github account](https://github.com/achow101). Some of these projects are for myself and others projects commissioned by others. Some of my projects involve modifying existing open source projects
